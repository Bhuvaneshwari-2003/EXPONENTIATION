# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
Get the input from the user.
Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.
Stop the program.

## Program:
/*
